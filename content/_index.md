JC STEM Lab of Intelligent Cybersecurity, co-hosted by the [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk/) of the [University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk), was established with generous donations from the [Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust](https://charities.hkjc.com/charities/english/charities-trust/index.aspx) and other organizations and corporations.

Our mission is to conduct cutting-edge research in the interdisciplinary area between computer/information security and machine learning. We endeavor to apply the latest methods and models in machine learning to security problems and to improve the security, privacy, and robustness of machine learning.

Our newest endeavor ventures into AI for biological sciences in collaboration with [Lab of Mechanobiology in Diseases](http://english.cemcs.cas.cn/sourcedb/ywrck/pi/202405/t20240527_663450.html), Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The lab has state-of-the-art computing facilities, including Nvidia H200 and H100 GPU clusters and abundant cloud computing resources.

We are recruiting researchers, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and interns who are passionate about exploring the frontier of cybersecurity, machine learning, and AI for biological sciences. Please send your CV to `chenho AT hku.hk`
